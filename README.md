## Summary

Cryptocurrencies come in many forms and provide their own "nodes" to interact with their given networks. While they implementations often provide similar functionalities, their exact process for completing transactions may be significantly different. In addition to this, there are many tasks involved with maintaining each of these nodes. Updating protocol versions, handling API changes, and more can become cumbersome and difficult to keep up with as the technological landscape shifts in a quickly evolving industry.

This Technology Specification aims to provide a way to provide a common infrastructure that can be shared and utilized by exchanges and wallets securely and reliably. A commmon implementation that has been reviewed and validated across both the community and those implementing the solutions allow for a common and validated implementation of these currencies and improves the overall User Experience for the user, developers, and exchange/wallet creators.
